# Frontend Mentor - Base Apparel coming soon page

![Design preview for the Fylo landing page with two column layout challenge](./src/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This is my solution for this challenge made by Frontend Mentor. It was meant to be done for just 1440px and 375px width, but I tried to make it more responsive. Any feedback you have for me will be well received. I used some packages in this repository to make easier its development. These packages are <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator">validator.js</a> and <a href="https://sweetalert2.github.io/">sweetalert2</a>.
